Student Information Chatbot
This repository contains the implementation of a Student Information Chatbot developed using Python and the nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) library. The chatbot is designed to respond to common queries related to a student's academic background, major, and interests, providing an interactive and educational tool.

Project Description
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a simple yet effective chatbot capable of answering predefined questions regarding a studentâ€™s academic details. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and process user inputs.

Key Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot uses the nltk library for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, which helps it interpret and respond to user queries.
Interactive Responses: It can respond to common questions about a student's name, course, university, major, and more.
Customizable and Scalable: The chatbot's design allows for easy expansion and customization, making it adaptable for various applications.
Benefits for Interview Preparation
Self-Evaluation: Users can practice answering interview questions, enhancing their confidence and readiness.
Consistent Rehearsal: The chatbot provides a platform for regular practice, helping users refine their responses.
Immediate Feedback: By interacting with the chatbot, users can instantly assess the clarity and quality of their answers.
Targeted Preparation: Users can tailor the chatbot's questions to focus on specific areas, making their preparation more effective.
